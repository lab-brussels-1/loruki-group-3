# Communication

## Group Rules

<!-- any general rules you'd like to set for your group? -->

- Communicate as much as we can.
- The one available will start a zoom meeting and send a link to the remaining
  of the team via Discord
- There will be a summary at the end of the meeting with all the details for the
  person that might not be in the meeting.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
